# Work-schedule


* We assigned a moment method to get the current date. In HTML file, we created a textarea and we assigned each text area from 9 to 5 and under each text area we created a button for each row.

* We then create a varaible and set it equals to query selector that search for and ID of textarea and then using for loop it iterates from 9 to 5 working schedule and using if statements we used id whether to see the past present and the future in the calendar and change color for each so it help user to see the current time past and future.

* We then created jquery to store the input into the local storage.
